\section{Introduction}

In December 2019 different cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan (China) \cite{huang2020clinical}. Their origin was later ascribed to a new virus classified as \textit{Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2} (SARS-CoV-2). The origin of this virus is still subject of scientific debate between the scientific community, however one of the most common opinion is that this virus comes from bats, in particular the genus Rhinolophus \cite{zhou2020pneumonia}. The most compelling feature of this virus is that is its ability to spread also via coughing and sneezing \cite{ghinai2020first}, and also by touching infected surfaces \cite{chang2020protecting}. Differently with respect to the SARS-CoV the virus seems to have a lower mortality rate \cite{sorensen2006severe,weiss2020clinical}. In January the Chinese government imposed the quarantine for the city of Wuhan (almost 11M people); the quarantine was later expanded to the full province of Hubei (60M people) and then to the neighbour provinces Huanggang, Ezhou and Xianning. 
The virus then spread in Canada, Germany, Thailand and Japan and then in other different countries included Italy \cite{timeline+web}. In Italy the first cases, two Chinese tourist from Hubei, were reported in Rome \cite{corr+roma}; then  other cases were reported in Codogno (Lodi,Lombardy). Later the virus spread almost in all regions of Italy with a higher density in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Marche. Starting from 22 of February, the Italian government started to impose the quarantine (red-zone) for 11 different municipalities, in particular Codogno, Casalpusterlengo, Lodi (included the neighbour municipalities) and Vo' Euganeo. Starting from this date different restrictive measures were imposted starting from the regions with the highest number of cases: public entrainment were almost suspended as well as schools and universities. Workers (in public and private sectors) were allowed, when possibile, to work at home (smart-working). Such measures culminated with a decree approved by the Italian government that divided Italy in three areas: the red zones in which the municipalities with highest number of cases in which all the population was subjected to quarantine, the yellow one (Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia Romagna) in which schools, universities and public events ,sports  as well cinemas were suspended and the rest of Italy in which no restrictive measures were adopted \cite{rep+dec1}; however 3 days later all schools and universities were suspended \cite{guard+01}
